# Etch-A-Sketch Task (for the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/))

## About
This is an online etch-a-sketch built using jQuery. I've also added a retro theme and a few extra features to the original brief, based on ideas from other members of the odin project.

This task was part of the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) a free online course teaching you web design and ruby (which I would highly reccomend). Its well structured, open source and totally free.  

## How to use

## Reflection (Reccomended by Odin Project)

WWW: This significantly improved my understanding of jQuery, and the flexibility of the library. I would like to do a project using its animation and transition functions to fully understand it better. I also enjoyed seeing other users work and seeing what ways you could expand on the base project (e.g. adding circles and eraser functions).

EBI: My git commit messages still need work to improve their clarity and I need to do more testing and proofing my code as I build.   I would also like to do some work in vanilla JS, so as not to become overly dependent on jQuery.

## About the Odin Project
This a task the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)\*  to make a copy of the google homepage (without the search functionality). It uses only HTML and CSS, and was built by looking at the original google page using dev tools. This is my first project using JQUERY,
